# Blackjack-2.0
### Welcome
Thank you for taking an interest in my blackjack game, this is a re-write of a previous project using better coding practices I have learned.
## Getting started
### Requirements
This game requires python 3.x to play
### Install
* Download the repository to the location of your choosing
* Navigate to the repository using the command line/terminal
* Run the command `python gameplay.py`
* The game should now begin
## Testing
There are unit tests that cover the code base should you wish to run them
To do so:
* Navigate to the repository using the command line/terminal
* Run the command `python test.py -b` (the -b will prevent the terminal from displaying any gameplay that may be part of tests, should you wish to see the gameplay run the command `python test.py`)
* The tests should now run
